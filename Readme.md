# Description

When pulling the trigger on an Xbox Core Controller on Win11 The Actiondata::Value seems to only be populated once it's above 0.75 and stops once it's below 0.65.

This corresponds with the rough physical depression of the button so I don't think it's a software thing

## Reproduce

Plug in controller and pull trigger, notice the values logged
